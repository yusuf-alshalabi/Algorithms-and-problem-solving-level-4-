# ðŸš€ Problem Solving - Level 4: Deep Dive into Date & Time (C++)

> ðŸŽ“ This repository showcases the solutions for *65 focused practice problems* from *Course 8* in the *Foundational Roadmap* for programming, created by *Eng. Mohammad Abu Hudhoud* (Programming Advices).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Focus and Learning Objectives

This problem-solving level is a comprehensive study dedicated to mastering *Date and Time manipulation* in *C++*, encompassing detailed work on:

* *Date Arithmetic:* Calculating differences, and performing complex additions/subtractions of time periods.
* *Calendar Mechanics:* Implementing logic for leap years, generating full month and year calendars, and determining day names.
* *Period Management:* Handling concepts like vacation days (excluding weekends), checking for date within periods, and detecting period overlaps.
* *Data Conversion:* Converting dates to total days of the year, and converting between date structures and string formats.
